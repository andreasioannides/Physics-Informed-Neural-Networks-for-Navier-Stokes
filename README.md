# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks-for-Navier-Stokes
This projects aims the development and training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes PDEs within a converging-diverging nozzle. The network is trained exclusively on point cloud data. The code supports both 2D and 3D equations, single and double arithmetic precision and first-, second-, and hybrid-order optimizers. The supported optimizers are Adam (via Keras), L-BFGS-B, BFGS, Broyden, SLSQP (via SciPy), Adam + L-BFGS-B, and Adam + BFGS. All hypermarameters are defined in the config.yaml file.
